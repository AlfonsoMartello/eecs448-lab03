    <h3>Bibliography:</h3>
    <p>Alfonso Martello is a Junior attending the University of Kansas. He is pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Mathematics. He was born in Lawrence, Kansas in 1999. His hobbies include 
        traveling, reading, playing videogames, playing piano, and learning new things. Over the summer of 2019 he studied abroad in Italy. That was pretty cool. The summer before that he took classes and worked full time. That was
        less cool but still interesting. On October 1st 2019, Alfonso made this webpage for his Software Engineering 1 class. He thought it was a pretty good first attempt at a webpage. </p>
